# Piraz's Neovim Init

This is my personal neovim configuration.

It is based on [ThePrimeagen's](https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/init.lua)
configuration, and I'm really thankful about his crazy explanation on
[this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7i4amO_zaE&) but right now this
project reflects what I need on neovim daily.

The project is a submodule of my [dotfiles](https://github.com/piraz/.dotfiles)
where I load most of my configurations for my Linux and Mac.

I recently made some changes, helping a friend, making this, and my dotfiles
able to run on Windows. It works, it took a long time to do that, and I still
ask my self why I did that.
